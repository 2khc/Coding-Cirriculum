<h1 id="chapter-2-programming-basics">Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h1>
<p>Before we can get into any coding stuff, we first need to understand some basic rules of programming first. Programming is pretty much all about taking in inputs and giving you out desired outputs. To make things a little bit more organised and understandable, these inputs and outputs are categorised into different groups called data types and are usually stored in variables.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-that-program-written-in-the-1st-chapter">What is that program written in the 1st chapter?</h2>
<p>Here is the short program that you wrote and ran in the last chapter:</p>
<pre><code> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(void)
 {
     printf("Hello, world");
 }
</code></pre>
<p>The first line of that program is '#include <stdio.h>', what this does is imports code into your program so that you can use things that have already been written by
other programmers for you to use. We programmers don't like to reinvent the wheel. The library being imported is 'stdio', which stands for standard input output. It allows
use to use the printf function. The thing we put in-between the parentheses is called an argument to the function. It is the information which we input into the function
for it to create some output. The output in this case is 'Hello, world'.</p>
<p>The next thing to consider is the 'int main(void)'. What is this?  We can see that int main(void) is followed by a curly bracket '{'. These curly brackets always come in pairs.
You can see that the one that completes the pair is the '}' at the very end of the program. Everything between these 2 curly brackets belong in the 'main' function.</p>
<p>Another important thing to remember is that the main function is the beginning of every C program.</p>
<pre><code> int main(void)
 {

 }
</code></pre>
<p>This has to exist in every C program and it is where everything begins.</p>
<h2 id="data-types">Data Types</h2>
<p>The C programming language provides five basic types: int, float, double, char and boolean</p>
<h3 id="the-integer-type-int">The Integer Type int</h3>
<p>A variable declared to be of type int can only contain integer values or values that do not have decimal places (and are therefore whole numbers). To display an int value at the terminal, the printf conversion characters %iV are used.</p>
<p>How would one declare a variable of type int?</p>
<pre><code> int myVariable;
</code></pre>
<p>It's as simple as that! If you want, you can also add a value to it as you're intialising it like so:</p>
<pre><code> int myVariable = 5;
</code></pre>
<p>Examples: -23, -83, 0, 435 and 1</p>
<h3 id="the-floating-number-type-float">The Floating Number Type float</h3>
<p>A variable declared to be of type float can be used for storing values containing decimal places. To display an int value at the terminal, the printf conversion characters %f are used. To express a value of type float, f or F is put after a value such as 14.5f or -122.23F.</p>
<p>Examples: 3.0, 23.42, -0.3329 and 9.023</p>
<p>Similar to the integer declaration, a float declaration would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code> float myVariable;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-type-double">The Type double</h3>
<p>The double type is very similar to the float type except that it is more precise. It can store approximately as many significant digits as can a variable declared to be of type float. All floating-point values are taken as the double type unless told otherwise.</p>
<pre><code> double myVariable;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-char-type">The char type</h3>
<p>The char type is used to store a single character. Characters can be declared by enclosing a pair of quotation marks around them as follows; ‘a’, ‘D’, ‘3’ and ’T’. To display a char value at the terminal, the printf conversion characters %c are used</p>
<pre><code> char myVariable;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-boolean-data-type-boolean">The Boolean Data Type boolean</h3>
<p>A variable declared to be of type boolean can only store 1 and 0 or True or False. boolean is used to indicate a Boolean condition or a condition which can be outputted to either true or false.</p>
<p>Using the Basic Data Types……..(put down the code written by Kelvin)</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Variables are named and used to store program computations or results. Variables can be named in a way that reflect the usage of the data stored. For example, I can create a variable called “numberOfpens” to store an int type which represents the number of pens I possess.</p>
<p>numberOfpens = 4;</p>
<h3 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>There are certain rules that we need to follow when it comes down to naming variables.</p>
<p>Variable names can’t begin with a number.
Embedded spaces are not permitted.
Variable names can’t be those that are same to reserved words in C e.g. int, float and so on.
$ is not a valid character.</p>
<p>Although we cannot include any spaces in our variable names, programmers tend to use underscores( _ ) or uppercase letters to represent next words.</p>
<pre><code> calculate_angle
 isTrue
</code></pre>
<h2 id="arithmetic-expressions">Arithmetic Expressions</h2>
<p>C’s arithmetic expressions work pretty much the same way as those we use in the real-world. However, some of the maths rules might not be as you expect depending on the type that a variable is declared to be.</p>
<p>When there are two or more operations the idea of priority or precedence is introduced to determine which operation is to be evaluated first.</p>
<p>The following notions are listed in an order of precedence.</p>
<p>multiplication sign -&gt; ( * )
division sign -&gt; ( / )
plus sign -&gt; ( + )
minus sign -&gt; ( - )</p>
<h2 id="a-few-extra-operations-to-consider">A Few Extra Operations to consider</h2>
<p>When you have an 'integer' variable, you can increment its value as follows:</p>
<pre><code> int number = 1;
 number = number + 1;
</code></pre>
<p>This would cause the value of number to increment by 1, as say the new value of number is the current value plus 1. This is often represented in short-form
like so:</p>
<pre><code> number++;
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically identical to 'number = number + 1;'. How about if you wish to increment by more than 1?</p>
<pre><code> number += 2;
</code></pre>
<p>Using '+=', we can cause an increment of +2, or whatever value we choose.</p>
<p>Finally, all all these work with decrementing values if we replace the '+' with a '-', pretty neat?</p>
<pre><code> number--;
 number -= 2;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to be lazy, this is just one of the many ways they chose to be so.</p>
<h2 id="exercises-lets-write-a-basic-calculator">Exercises: Let's Write a Basic Calculator!</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is prepare to prepare the file for use. We are going to be displaying things on the terminal, and asking for input, so we'll need to
include the 'stdio' library.</p>
<pre><code> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(void)
 {

 }
</code></pre>
<p>We now need to ask for user input, and store the input into some variables, so that we can add them together later.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int numberOne;
  int numberTwo;

  printf("Enter 2 numbers to add together:\n");
  scanf("%d", &amp;numberOne);
  scanf("%d". &amp;numberTwo);

  printf("%d + %d = %d", numberOne, numberTwo, numberOne + numberTwo);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some new things have creeped up in this exercise. What does this 'scanf' do? Well, it takes input from the console then puts it into the variable stated in the second
argument of the function.</p>
<pre><code>  scanf("%d", &amp;numberOne);
</code></pre>
<p>This takes your input value and assigns it to numberOne, such that numberOne holds whatever whole number you decide to input.</p>
<p>But wait a second, what is this "%d" that is in both the 'printf' and 'scanf' in the first arguments? This "%d" is a formatter that is applied to the value of the argument
in the same function. For example, in the above example of scanf, the number input into the terminal is then assigned to the variable 'numberOne'.</p>
<p>In the printf, 'numberOne' is placed into the first %d, 'numberTwo' is placed into the second %d, the value of the sum of 'numberOne + numberTwo' is placed into the
3rd %d.</p>
<p>This concludes this chapter, as you have learn to write a basic calculator that</p>
