Coding Curriculum – Overview of Design Specifications 

Below are a number of factors considered in designing and implementing our project. Each factor has been justified appropriately.

1.	Age range – we are targeting candidates sitting their GCSE examinations, such as yourselves, i.e. age range 14-16. This is because:
•	Your age range is more suited to our chosen programming language (C), which is a little more complex than some more beginner-friendly languages such as Python. 
•	Learning about Computer Science at this age may inspire you to take an A-Level in the subject, and possibly consider a degree or even a career in Computer Science.
2.	Language being taught – we are teaching the C programming language. This is because:
•	C has a large number of practical applications and can be used as a springboard for you learners to make their own projects. Other languages e.g. HTML (which isn’t strictly a programming language), generally need supports like CSS in order to work well. C is “standalone” in that sense.
•	C provides a nice introduction to procedural programming.
3.	STEM theme – our chosen STEM theme is mathematics. We want to teach you how to program in a mathematics context; i.e. with an end goal of making an application that helps people with mathematics.
4.	Description of learning experience:
•	We have made a number of different calculators that provide various functions. We want you to progress through the structured lessons and gain a solid grounding in C
•	This includes ideas like the various loops (while, if, for), variables, basic data structures, functions, libraries and so on.
•	As you progress through the lessons, you will eventually end up building a calculator just like the one provided by us, with the same functionality. This will test and consolidate what you have learnt.
