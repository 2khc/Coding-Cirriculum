    Welcome to C-alculator 

But first let’s start from the very start. What exactly is programming? Is it the act of scheduling a television or radio program? Well yeah it is but not in the context we’re using it. Programming in general would be to provide specific instructions to a computer to do a certain task. These instructions usually take the form of an algorithm, a procedure to solve a problem or to carry out a specific task, in one of the many programming languages which are designed to communicate instructions to a machine. These may include writing an algorithm to make a robot move around in a circle, just like telling a dog to roll over.

Now, why should we learn C programming? Firstly, C has been there for a long time! The first C programming language was written in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. C is a very low level language which means the source code we have written in C is very close to machine code which is the language the CPU understands.  It is a compiled language which is faster than higher level language while learning. As its name suggests, compared to low level languages it is further from machine code and closer to English language. Furthermore, C programming language has been the basis for a lot of other higher level programming languages like Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C++, Objective C and a lot more. Learning the basics of C and its syntax will also help beginners learn other C based languages much more efficiently. 

Well enough of this boring introduction, let’s start learning and have some fun!

Coding Curriculum – Overview of Design Specifications 

Below are a number of factors considered in designing and implementing our project. Each factor has been justified appropriately.

1.	Age range – we are targeting candidates sitting their GCSE examinations, such as yourselves, i.e. age range 14-16. This is because:
•	Your age range is more suited to our chosen programming language (C), which is a little more complex than some more beginner-friendly languages such as Python. 
•	Learning about Computer Science at this age may inspire you to take an A-Level in the subject, and possibly consider a degree or even a career in Computer Science.
2.	Language being taught – we are teaching the C programming language. This is because:
•	C has a large number of practical applications and can be used as a springboard for you learners to make their own projects. Other languages e.g. HTML (which isn’t strictly a programming language), generally need supports like CSS in order to work well. C is “standalone” in that sense.
•	C provides a nice introduction to procedural programming.
3.	STEM theme – our chosen STEM theme is mathematics. We want to teach you how to program in a mathematics context; i.e. with an end goal of making an application that helps people with mathematics.
4.	Description of learning experience:
•	We have made a number of different calculators that provide various functions. We want you to progress through the structured lessons and gain a solid grounding in C
•	This includes ideas like the various loops (while, if, for), variables, basic data structures, functions, libraries and so on.
•	As you progress through the lessons, you will eventually end up building a calculator just like the one provided by us, with the same functionality. This will test and consolidate what you have learnt.
