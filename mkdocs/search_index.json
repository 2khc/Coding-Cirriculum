Is it the act of scheduling a television or radio program? Well yeah it is but not in the context we\u2019re using it. Programming in general would be to provide specific instructions to a computer to do a certain task. These instructions usually take the form of an algorithm, a procedure to solve a problem or to carry out a specific task, in one of the many programming languages which are designed to communicate instructions to a machine. These may include writing an algorithm to make a robot move around in a circle, just like telling a dog to roll over.\n\n\nNow, why should we learn C programming? Firstly, C has been there for a long time! The first C programming language was written in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. C is a very low level language which means the source code we have written in C is very close to machine code which is the language the CPU understands.  It is a compiled language which is faster than higher level language while learning. As its name suggests, compared to low level languages it is further from machine code and closer to English language. Furthermore, C programming language has been the basis for a lot of other higher level programming languages like Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C++, Objective C and a lot more. Learning the basics of C and its syntax will also help beginners learn other C based languages much more efficiently. \n\n\nWell enough of this boring introduction, let\u2019s start learning and have some fun!",

You'll be needing a text editor. If you're looking for something with a nice and beautiful theme, we recommend \nSublime Text 3\n, if you want something\na little more plain you can simply go for \nNotepad++\n.\n\n\nThe next step is to install a C \ncompiler\n onto your computer. \"What is a compiler?\", you ask... Well, as mentioned earlier, C is a low-level programming language meaning that the commands in C are closely related to the instructions that your \ncomputer processing unit\n would run. \nHOWEVER\n, this still means that the language is undirectly unreadable by the CPU, as such, you need to first compile your code\nsuch that it is translated into a form that your CPU can run.\n\n\nDownload the compiler \nhere\n, you can see the button for \"Download Installer\" at the top right corner of the page.\n\n\nOpen your note editor and create a new file, save it with the C file extension, for example: \"lesson1.c\". We've decided to adhere to traditions so your first program will be a \"Hello, world!\" program, first this first lesson, just type out everything we tell you to, as the ultimate aim of this section is to teach you how to compile and run your code.\n\n\n #include \nstdio.h\n\n\n int main(void)\n {\n     printf(\"Hello, world\");\n }\n\n\n\nThat's it! A fully working program, but how do we run it? We can't simply just double-click on the file and hope it would do something useful... In other worlds, we must first compile it.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, open your command-line or terminal. To do this on Windows, press Windows + R, then type cmd into the box and hit 'OK'. Meet the command-line interface, this scary black window, you'll become good friends with it on your programming journeys.\n\n\nNavigate to the directory on your computer in which you saved the file.\n\n\nFor example, if I am currently in \"C:/users/Documents\" and I want to go into \"C:/users/Documents/code\", I would type \"cd code\" to move into the \"code\" folder.\n\n\nIf you wish to move up a folder, on Windows you can type \"cd..\", on an Mac or Linux type \"cd ..\" (make sure to include that space).\n\n\nNext, we shall compile the code.\n\n\nType \"gcc\" followed by the name of your file, then followed by the name you wish the compiled code to be.\n\n\nFor example \"gcc lesson1.c output\".\n\n\nThe compile file is now called output, and to run it you can type \"output\" and see the results of your program.\n\n\n\n\nIf you found this all simple enough, the real programming begins next lesson, as well as an introduction to what everything means, that program we just wrote together will all make sense very soon!\n\n\nExtra Task\n\n\nNow that you know how to compile your code, spend a few minutes exploring your computer through the command-line, move around! Pick a distant folder and try to move into it from where you currently are! Try opening other files through the command-line\u2026 next time you want to listen to a music file, navigate there by command-line!",

I've always been interested in programming and all the wonders one can do with technology if he knows how it is programmed and how to program one himself. With a keen interest on it from a child, i decided to do my Bsc on computer science and learn the DNA of computer programs.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\nI'm Thomas, a first year computer science student at UCL.
